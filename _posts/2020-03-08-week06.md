title: Week 6:Choosing a project
---

What an exciting week in Open Source! Not only we were fortunate enough to hear from [Vicky Steeves](https://vickysteeves.com/) again, but we also had the opportunity to really dive deep into some cool open source projects that we could potentially contribute to by the end of the semester. 

## Another Great Guest Lecture 


## Project Deep Dive
This week I had the opportunity to explore open source projects more deeply. Last week I did look at projects like OpenEMR, but I did not really read through the code or see how frequently people contributed. This week however, through writing evaluations I really got a sense of different projects: how inviting their community was, how active contributors (both new and old) are, and if I could actually see myself contributing to the project.

The first project I was assigned to evaluate was [SugarLabs](https://www.sugarlabs.org/) which supports Sugar, a collaborative learning environment designed for children so they can interact with computers in an easy, flexible way. Completing this evaluation allowed to look at different aspects of a project that I would not have known to look at before. For example at one point we had to calculate how long issues stayed open. This gave me a great indication of how responsive SugarLabs was to people who wanted to contribute. While this information is super helpful, I personally would not have thought to seek this out. I also was asked to read through the interactions in the issues and the pull requests which gave me a sense of how open the SugarLabs community was to newbies. 

Overall although the SugarLabs community is super responsive and willing to help newbies I was not particularly drawn to their project. My python skills arenâ€™t that strong and installation took a while because I had to set up a virtual machine. However I do encourage others who may like this project to check out my [evaluation](https://github.com/nyu-ossd-s20/project-evaluation/blob/master/SugarLabs.md). 


For my next evalution I decided to check out [p5.js](https://github.com/processing/p5.js).
