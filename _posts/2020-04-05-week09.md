title: Week 9:Cathedrals, Bazaars and Wireframing
---

This week in Open Source we had the opportunity to explore the benefits of Open Source by reading **The Cathedral and the Bazaar**, an essay by Eric S. Raymond and by hearing from the Verizon Media Director of Open Source and Technology [Gil Yehuda](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gilyehuda/detail/recent-activity/posts/).

In addition to learning more about Open Source, my group members and I continued to work on our Open Source contribution this week.
