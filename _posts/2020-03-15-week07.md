title: Week 7:Found A Project!
---

Despite the chaoticness of this week (switching from in person lectures to online) I must say in this class the transition was pretty smooth as we moved onto the next stage - contributing to an open source project as a group. This past Wednesday I found out who I would be working with for the rest of the semester. My new team members and I then spent the rest of the week deciding what project we would be working on exactly and what kind of contribution we would be making. 


## What's the project?
My team members and I did not have much overlap in the projects we were initially interested in, but we were all interested in working with a project in JavaScript. Ultimately what was important for us was finding a project where the community was really open to first time contributors. We decided on [Oppia](https://www.oppia.org/splash) because not only were we intrigued by their mission but also their active, helpful community. When we reached out to them initially we got a response within 10 minutes and currently have a contact at Oppia who is determined to help us make a meaningful contribution.
