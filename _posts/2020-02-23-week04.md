title: Week 4:The World of Open Data 
---


This week I had the pleasure of hearing from Deena Engel and Vicky Steeves, both experts of "Open Data". My peers and I learned about the various resources and tools one uses when working with Open Data, the challenges around working with propriety data, how to "clean" data, and overall the possibilities and applications of working with open data. 

I have actually taken Deena's class "Database Design and Web Implementation" where I learned about different places to find Open Data like "NYC Open Data". This week however I learned from Vicky about [awesome-public-datasets](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets) hosted on GitHub. Here you can find different open datasets broken down by category. In the class I took with Deena I mostly cleaned datasets using Python leveraging libraries like Beautiful Soup. I enjoyed learning about other tools like OpenRefine and Tableau. While Deena and Vicky did introduce us to these tools, I hope to do further research into them and learn how I can use them to clean and organize large amounts of data.
