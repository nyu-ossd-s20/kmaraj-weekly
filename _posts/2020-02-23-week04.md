title: Week 4:The World of Open Data 
---


This week I had the pleasure of hearing from Deena Engel and Vicky Steeves, both experts of "Open Data". My peers and I learned about the various resources and tools one uses when working with Open Data, the challenges around working with propriety data, how to "clean" data, and overall the possibilities and applications of working with open data.
