Senior at NYU from Brooklyn, NY. Enjoy tech, film and standup. She/Her/Hers.

### More Information

My name is Karishma and I am a senior at NYU studying Computer Science. Aside from Computer Science I am also passionate about the film and entertainment industry. After graduation I am going to be a full time iOS developer and I hope to use my technical skills to build tools in this sector. 

In my free time I am currently working on two iOS applications where I am leveraging open source projects. The tools others developers have provided have been really helpful in my personal growth as a developer, and I hope this class gives me the opportunity to make impactful contributions to these projects and more.
